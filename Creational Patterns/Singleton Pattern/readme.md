# Singleton Pattern
## Introduction
In software engineering, it is a common requirement to ensure that a class has only a single instance and to provide a global point of access to that instance. The Singleton Pattern addresses this need by limiting instantiating a class to a single object. In this article, we'll explore the Singleton Pattern in the context of C# and .NET, discussing how to implement it, use cases, and examples.

## Understanding the Singleton Pattern:
The Singleton Pattern is a creative design pattern that ensures that there is only one instance of a class, and that a global access point to that instance is provided. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing access to a shared resource or controlling an application's configuration settings.
